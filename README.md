# Basic Blockchain

Based on [this tutorial](https://medium.com/coinmonks/implementing-blockchain-and-cryptocurrency-with-pow-consensus-algorithm-part-1-545fb32be0c2) on Medium by [Kashish Khullar](https://medium.com/@kashishkhullar)
For node.js-setup with typescript [this tutorial](https://khalilstemmler.com/blogs/typescript/node-starter-project/) was helpful.

## TODO
- [] follow tutorial and implement refactored into functional style
- [] write tests with jest (get them running)
- [] host on different nodes (raspi, digitalocean, laptop)
